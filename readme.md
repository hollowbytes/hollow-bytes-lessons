## Prerequisites
### Install one of these IDE's
  * [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
    * *Visual Studio* is commonly used in pure .NET shops and is good to get under your belt
  * [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/#section=windows)
    * *Rider* is commonly used in environments with multiple languages since Jetbrains offers a variety of IDEs for languages (WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand)
  * *[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)* is not a true IDE and is more of a text editor on steroids

### SDKS
You shouldn't need to download any SDKs yourself, your IDE typically manages them in a virtual environment. This makes it easier to swap between different projects that use different versioning. [.NET SDKS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks) follow a pattern where even numbers are long term support and odd numbers are short term support.

### Install Git
Any IDE you install will already have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) but it's good to have this installed globally. Having it installed allows you to quickly clone repos without having to open an IDE or understanding other version control web platforms.

### Github
Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one. Next go to the [lessons repo](https://github.com/hollowbytes/hollow-bytes-lessons) and fork it to your own account. Forking will allow you to make your own changes without affecting the source repository, but still allow you to get updates. Other popular version control web platforms are [Atlassians BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/) or [Azures Team Foundation Version Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/what-is-tfvc?view=azure-devops), although they are not as commonly used. 

## Interview Questions
Companies will ask you about the version control tool you've used, if you know git, and what IDEs you have experience with. It is also good to ask them these questions too if they do not so you get an idea of the environment you will be working in.
