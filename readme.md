## Prerequisites
### Install one of these IDE's
  * [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
  * [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/#section=windows)
  
*Visual Studio* is commonly used in pure .NET shops and is good to get under your belt  
*Rider* is commonly used in environments with multiple languages since Jetbrains offers a variety of IDEs for languages (WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand)  
*Visual Studio Code* is not a true IDE and is a red flag if a company cannot provide proper licensing for tooling  
&nbsp; *  Note you still need a license for doing C# with VS Code in an enterprise environment 

### SDKS
You shouldn't need to download any SDKs yourself, your IDE typically manages them in a virtual environment. This makes it easier to swap between different projects that use different versioning.

### Install [git](https://git-scm.com/)
Any IDE you install will already have git but its good to have this installed globally. Having it installed allows you to quickly clone repos without having to open an IDE.

### GitHub
Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one.
