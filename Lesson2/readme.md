## Classes
In lesson one we used a top level statement to execute the code, this lesson will have the fully implemented class [(link)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/main-command-line). 

You will notice a few new things in this class:
* [Namespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/namespaces)
* [Access modifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/access-modifiers)
* [Classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes)
* [Methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods)
* [Static](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/static)

*Namespaces* are commonly used to organize modules or features of code, they typically match your projects folder structure. 

The project you're working in will contain a root namespace everything in that project stems from.  

*Access modifiers* are used to help guide developers what is accessible to others or not from outside different [scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers#summary-table).

*Classes* are you bread and butter. They'll contain your properties, fields, constructors, methods, etc...  

*Methods* are your units that encapsulate behavior, these are what you call for your program to do something  

*Static* is a keyword that should be used lightly. Something that is static has a single instance for the life of the application. It does not need to be instantiated.  

*Reference Types* a kind of variable in C#

*Arrays* a kind of collection in C#

## [Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names)
All classes are to be named [PascalCase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names#pascal-case)

## Interview questions
You will most likely be asked about access modifiers, the pros and cons to static, and what a class and method are used for.
